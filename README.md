## Template

PDB:7DA6 is in the open / substrate bound form.
It does not deviate too much from the XChem structures bar the everting SEYYP loop (cf Tyr89) and catalytic Cys110.


* PDB:7DA6 C100A energy minimised against its electron density with PyRosetta
* aligned against XChem hits
* mutated the A100C back
* stripped of non-polymers and peptide chain C

The Dunbrack rotamer is perfectly placed for H-bonding with His21,
but I didn't bother changing the protonation (CYS110 to CYZ, HID21 to HIE, ASP39 to ASH).

## OE Rocs

Multiple datasets from Enamine libraries were made and tested against the P1 hits + peptide.

These were then 'redocked' with Fragmenstein and sorted by energy.
For reactives, The distance to the reactive group was also calculated and everything with 3Ã… was kept.
